## Dolphin service menu: Compress / backup directory to SquashFS

SquashFS can be easily mounted, so it's often more convenient than usual archives for backups and other purposes. No root required (but there is an option to use root).

When using [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) compression, you can choose compression level.

See also [SquashFS mounter / unmounter](https://github.com/shvchk/dolphin-squashfs-mount) (no root required, too).

## Dolphin service menu: Compress / backup directory to SquashFS

SquashFS can be easily mounted, so it's often more convenient than usual archives for backups and other purposes. No root required.

See also [SquashFS mounter / unmounter](https://github.com/shvchk/dolphin-squashfs-mount) (no root required, too).
